## 🎯 Implementation Date: 2025-09-06 02:09:09 UTC

### ✅ Problem Solved
- **Issue**: Filter functionality was only working for job listings (구인정보), not for job seekers (구직자정보)
- **Solution**: Implemented completely independent filter systems for both sections

### 🔧 Technical Implementation

#### 구인정보 필터 시스템 (Job Listings Filters)
- **Search Input**: `job-search-input` - Company name, job title, location search
- **Visa Filter**: `job-visa-filter` - Required visa types (E-7, E-9, H-2, F-4, etc.)
- **Category Filter**: `job-category-filter` - Job categories (IT, Manufacturing, Services, etc.)
- **Functions**: `applyJobFilters()`, `clearJobFilters()`

#### 구직자정보 필터 시스템 (Job Seeker Filters)  
- **Search Input**: `jobseeker-search-input` - Name, nationality, desired job category search
- **Visa Filter**: `jobseeker-visa-filter` - Desired visa types 
- **Category Filter**: `jobseeker-category-filter` - Desired job categories
- **Functions**: `applyJobSeekerFilters()`, `clearJobSeekerFilters()`

### 🎨 UI Improvements
- **Color-coded sections**: Blue theme for jobs, Green theme for job seekers
- **Compact design**: Smaller, efficient filter controls for job seeker section
- **Section headers**: Clear visual separation with icons and titles
- **Responsive layout**: Works perfectly on mobile and desktop

### 📊 Filter Capabilities
- **Real-time search**: 300ms debounced input for optimal performance
- **Independent state**: Each section maintains its own filter state
- **API integration**: Proper parameter mapping to backend endpoints
- **Instant filtering**: Dropdown changes trigger immediate results
