Fix Dashboard Routing Authentication Issue

Fixed critical dashboard routing issue where clicking admin button and other dashboard buttons redirected users to login page instead of their respective dashboards.

Changes:
- Added explicit route handlers for all dashboard pages
- Implemented proper authentication checks using localStorage tokens  
- Added user type verification for each dashboard
- Fixed admin, agent, employer, instructor, and jobseeker dashboard routing

This resolves the main user complaint where dashboard buttons were not working correctly after login.
